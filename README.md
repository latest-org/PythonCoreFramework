# PythonCoreFramework
Python core implemented in F# language and under dotnetcore 3.1 or later.

As of April 2020, i have started on the parser for Python 3.9 grammar and will create all needed unittests to make sure 
parser is doing its job correctly. Then i will implement the full Tokenizer with its UnitTests.

This is the first part of what i hope will be a core implementation of Python interpreter / compiler for use under dot net core 3.1 
or later on several different Ooperating Systems and machines, including the Raspberry Pi 4 or later.

The idea for parser subsystem is to implement Roslyn like functions for python source code analyzis and modifications based on using
the framework i am hoping will be usefull some time in the future. It is really early in the development process and sometime before
it can be used for analyzing of source code as the first step.
